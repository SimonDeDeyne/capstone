			<p>Thank you for participating in a project on colour perception. This research aims to investigate the effect of language on colour perception.</p>
			 
			<p>Participants were separated into two groups which would each perform 2 tasks within a repeated measures design. One experiment required students to undergo a verbal interference task whereas the other did not. Participants were not told in advance what colours or what interference task they would undergo.</p>
			 
			<p>If you experience discomfort (eg eye strain, wrist fatigue, or headache) completing the visual search task as it is administered on a laptop screen, you may contact the researchers using email addresses provided above to contact a relevant medical service. </p>

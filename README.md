## Code for the Colour and Linguistic Classifier Projects

The experiments are coded with [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response/).

These are very preliminary first drafts of the experiments. They will require input (instructions etc.), and the 
procedures need refinements (counter-balancing of responses etc.).

You should be able to run these experiments on your own computer by downloading the repository.
The code has only been tested using a recent version of Chrome, so try to only use that browser.
Also you probably want to turn of anything that might interfere (such as plugins, messenger or other stuff happening in the background). When testing this becomes a concern when accurate RTs are needed. Something to discuss...

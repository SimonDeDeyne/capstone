# Capstone Projects

## Code for the Colour and Linguistic Classifier Projects

The experiments are coded with [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response/).

These are very preliminary first drafts of the experiments. They will require input (instructions etc.), and the 
procedures need refinements (counter-balancing of responses etc.).
